### The Beer Problem




I stayed home and pre-gamed it with 4 beers before Ubering to the bar. I can normally throw down 3 Beers each hour at the bar. I was at the bar for 4 hours. How many Beers did I consume? 

  



### The _'b'_ Value




The standard equation for a line is, \(y = mx + b\). As we have learned, the \(b\) part of the equation is where the line crosses the vertical access, often referred to as the _initial condition_. 




#### Initial Condition




The _b_ value is considered the _initial_ condition for this problem (pre-game Beers). (Starting at the origin x = 0, or in this case, t = 0). 





Let's take a look at the figure below and break it down.





### The Beer Problem

We know the initial condition, \(b\) is \(4 Beers\), giving in the problem. The rate at which beer is consumed is \(\frac{3 Beers}{Hour}\), which was also giving. Finally, the question asks, how many total beers after \(4 hours\) were consumed. 





As you can see from the figure, every time an hour passes, 3 beers are consumed (count them). This corresponds with the rate or _m_ value. Therefore,
\[Rate = m = \frac{3 Beers}{Hour}\]


#### Solution


Filling in the full equation we get:


 \[\#Beers = \frac{3 Beers}{Hour} * 4 Hours + 4 Beers = 16 Beers\] 




This short video describes the whole process.
