<h3>The Beer Problem</h3>
<p>I can chug a beer pretty fast. I recently timed myself drinking a full 12oz Beer (355mL) in just about 6 seconds. At what rate is the beer flowing down my throat?</p>
</div>
<div id="slope" class="section level3">
<h3>Slope</h3>
<p>The slope formula, <span class="math inline">\(m = \frac{rise}{run}\)</span>, is a powerful tool for calculating and comparing steepness, or rates of changes. This is a very useful tool used in all aspects of engineering, mathematics, and even deep learning with neural networks.</p>
<div id="rate-of-change" class="section level4">
<h4>Rate of Change</h4>
<p>Did you know that the slope of a line is also referred to as the <em>rate</em> of change of the line?</p>
<p>Think about traveling on along a line on the x-y coordinate system. As you change from one position to the next, imagine time being passed in the horizontal direction and some other measurement being changed in the vertical direction. <span class="math display">\[m = \frac{Some Changing Quantity}{Amount Time Passed}\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="flow" class="section level4">
<h4>Flow</h4>
<p>In the case with beer, it’s the number of seconds passed along the horizontal and the amount of mili-liters changed during that time.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="math display">\[m = \frac{Beer Changed}{Time Lapsed}\]</span></p>
<p>The graphic depicted above starts off with a full beer (355mL). As time passes, due to a negative rate of change of volume (-mL/s e.g. chugging), notice it is empty around the 6 second mark.</p>
<p>A convenient shortcut used to denote a <em>change</em> in quantity is to use the Greek letter Delta, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>.The slope equation now becomes, <span class="math display">\[m =\frac{\Delta mL}{\Delta t}; t &gt; 0\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(t &gt; 0\)</span> states that the line is not defined prior to <span class="math inline">\(t = 0\)</span>.</p>

<h3>Chug Video</h3>
<p>This short video describes how rates of change of beer can be determined by examining the <em>slope</em>, or <em>rate of change</em>, of the line. The word <em>flow</em> means the rate at which volume changes per unit of time that passes.</p>
