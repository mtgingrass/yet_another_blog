### The Beer Problem




I can chug a beer pretty fast. I recently timed myself drinking a full 12oz Beer (355mL) in just about 6 seconds. At what rate is the beer flowing down my throat?




### Slope




The slope formula, \(m = \frac{rise}{run}\), is a powerful tool for calculating and comparing steepness, or rates of changes. This is a very useful tool used in all aspects of engineering, mathematics, and even deep learning with neural networks.





#### Rate of Change




Did you know that the slope of a line is also referred to as the _rate_ of change of the line? 

Think about traveling on along a line on the x-y coordinate system. As you change from one position to the next, imagine time being passed in the horizontal direction and some other measurement being changed in the vertical direction. \[m = \frac{Some Changing Quantity}{Amount Time Passed}\] 

#### Flow

In the case with beer, it's the number of seconds passed along the horizontal and the amount of mili-liters changed during that time.

 \[m = \frac{Beer Changed}{Time Lapsed}\] 



The graphic depicted above starts off with a full beer (355mL). As time passes, due to a negative rate of change of volume (-mL/s e.g. chugging), notice it is empty around the 6 second mark. 





A convenient shortcut used to denote a _change_ in quantity is to use the Greek letter Delta, \(\Delta\).The slope equation now becomes, \[m =\frac{\Delta mL}{\Delta t}; t > 0\]





\(t > 0\) states that the line is not defined prior to \(t = 0\).


### Chug Video




This short video describes how rates of change of beer can be determined by examining the _slope_, or _rate of change_, of the line. The word _flow_ means the rate at which volume changes per unit of time that passes.
