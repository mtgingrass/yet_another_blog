<h1>AmazonBasics 60-Inch Lightweight Tripod with Bag. Amazon’s tripod video review.</h1>
<p>This tripod will not test the stand of time. The rivets will eventually fall out. It’s still useable but very flimsy. Overall, $21 for a good year and half of use if you are some what careful. If you want something to last years, this is not your tripod.</p>
