  4. Next, save the macro as something meaningful. If you are autosizing columns, then name it "AutoSizeColumns" or something similar with no spaces. Also, decide if you want to store this macro on this particular workbook (the file) or if you want to store it on your Personal Workbook which can be used on any file. Once you click OK, you are recording.![](http://devgin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Save-Macro-As-300x247.png)
