<h3>What is a GitHub?</h3>
<p>Recently, I went to search for a few jobs in the tech industry and one thing stood out with each of the sites I visited. Everyone was asking “What’s your GitHub address?” Admittedly, I didn’t have one until just the other day.</p>
<blockquote>
I posted this short five minute tutorial to get you started early!
</blockquote>
<p>GitHub is a repository for version control hosting of coding projects and much more. You can upload code and share it with teammates, partners, yourself, and the general public. Git without the Hub, is a version control system that Linus Trovalds (creator of Linux) created. If you have ever wanted to revert back to yesterday’s code because you can’t find that pesty bug, GitHub could be your answer.</p>

<h3>What projects to put on GigHub?</h3>
<p>There are a couple of ways to build your portfolio on GitHub. Do not be intimidated by the professional looking, expert quality, vastly larger repositories you see on the public GitHub sites.</p>
<p>Companies understand that you are a one person team and they are just looking for clear, concise, and workable code. Here is my approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Post school projects on GitHub even if they are not programming related. For instance, in Linear Algebra you learned some cool math techniques that require tons of hand calculations. Turn that into a quick C++ or Python program and submit it.</p></li>
<li><p>The small pieces matter. Always think about what others want to learn when you post. Somebody else is trying to accomplish the same thing you have. They may be missing one key piece of the puzzle. Be that key and unlock another users potential.</p></li>
<li><p>Start a project you are interested in.  I am starting a project to <a href="http://devgin.com/r-programming-twitter-scraper/">scrape Twitter</a>, parse and manipulate the text, create a <a href="http://devgin.com/build-word-cloud-twitter-using-r/">word cloud</a>, then autogenerate content to auto-post to a blog. Bite size chucks at a time.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, I learned how to program in R enough to get in trouble.</p></li>
<li><p>Next I learned how to manipulate texts, strip white spaces, strip certain words and symbols, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Then I learned about connecting to the Twitter API and pulling data from Twitter into my program.</p></li>
<li><p>I wanted an easy way to share code so I next learned how to auto-publish to a WordPress site.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, I put all the pieces together to create one descent project (actually, it needs a ton of work).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Post previous projects you completed just to get something started.</p></li>
<li><p>Clone a project you are interested in and make improvements.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
The possibilities are endless. The key takeaway here is to just get started and don’t pass this up. Employers are looking!

<h3>Step by Step</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Download GitHub Desktop Version either in Linux, Mac, or Windows free <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">here.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Download R then R Studio if you don’t already have them installed.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a GitHub account free <a href="http://www.github.com">here</a>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Create a new repository. A repository is like a directory to hold your project in, nothing fancy.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the link of your new repository.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Start a new R Studio Project and choose Version Control.</p></li>
