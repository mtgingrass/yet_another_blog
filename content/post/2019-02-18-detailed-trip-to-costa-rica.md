## Pre-plan

### Where to go and why?

I chose to go to Costa Rica for a few reasons:

*  It's winter in February in Washington DC and I wanted to go some place warm.
*  I found a good deal on plane tickets. 
*  I heard great things about the country.
*  I want to learn Spanish.
*  It offers both scenary/events as well as partying.


### Ticket Details

I purchased round trip tickets to Costa Rica from an app called Skyscanner. I chose the dates so one day will fall on a holiday for me and save a vacation day. I took five days of vacation while visiting Costa Rica for 10 days! Not a bad deal. 

*  Round Trip Tickets Cost: $477 Each
*  Travel Dates: February 9-18 (10 Days)

**Depart**: Baltimore MD to Atlanta GA to San Jose, Costa Rica.

**Arrive**: San Jose to El Salvador to Washington DC.

### Packing Details

I planned on at least half of my time at the beach and the other half hiking, four wheeling, zip lines other outdoorsy events. I had two criteria to meet:

1.  Pack light enough to just use a carryon bag. 
2.  Pack enough to last 10 days.

When I know I am swimming at the beach or pool area I can reduce the number of socks and underware to take. Just reuse your bathing suit. However, a word of caution - *my clothes ended up smelling pretty bad*. In hindsight, just splurge about halfway through the trip and pay for laundry service. 

>  my clothes ended up smelling pretty bad


I am not going to go into packing details too much but I want to talk about proper footwear and how important this is. Keep in mind I want to pack light. I brought my typical going out shoes (New Balance skateboard shoes) and a pair of [Merrell Men's Trail Glove 4 Runner](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MS9J0YB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) shoes.

These shoes were perfect for getting wet and for hiking jagged rocks. I even climbed a Ficus tree with them on. However, the shoes glue came off on edges as you can tell from the photo.

## Day 1 - San Jose

### Arival

Upon arival I planned on using my phone to get an Uber driver. I have Verizon Wireless as my carrier. I couldn't, for the life of me, get the internet to work. I thought that I would just pay the $10 per day for international data. I also thought it was automatic. It wasn't. 

Since we didn't check our bags, we went straight out of the airport exit. Very quickly we were approached by dozens of *taxi* drivers. Each one tried for our business over and over again. If you say, "I've got a ride, I am good" (in Spanish if you can), they will ask you, "With who, which company?" They were very much in your bubble trying for your business constantly. 

I read about not using taxis in Costa Rica over and over again so I tried desperately not to use this service. I finally found a person who claimed to be an Uber driver. He didn't have the app or any indication of working for Uber on the car. He obviously wasn't an Uber driver but I didn't care. I asked him how much to get to [Hostel Pangea](http://www.hostelpangea.com/)? He said $15 US. I was on it! Didn't care if he was a random person or not. Honestly, that's part of the experience or me. He took me to an ATM and I withdrew US dollars and Costa Rican Colones. 

The drivers in Costa Rica are crazy lol. You will read about that all over the internet as well. I thought it was kind of funny how different they drive than me, in DC area. I almost want to believe that pedestrians do not have the right away at all in this country. I swear the driver was goign to clip every pedestrian he passed. He also rode right up on ass of the car in front of him. Anyway, made it to [Hostel Pangia](http://www.hostelpangea.com/) safely.

### Hostel
Checked into the hostel around 10PM with no problems. Our room had a stand up shower with one glass wall on the bottom floor. It was really cool actually. Upstairs was a bed overlooking the shower. Definitly a nice view if you know what I mean.

**Pros:**

*  Beatiful view
*  Plenty of room
*  Affordable
*  Great location
*  Friendly

**Cons:**

*  No hot water

I asked the desk clerk where the bars were at. He said if I go left I will find the "American bar." Then he said at night, do not go right or you will get into a fight. Interesting. So we walked maybe 100 feet to the "American bar" and had a few cervesas. 

One thing to note, and I will repeat this a few times, is to **never flush toilet paper in the toilet**. You will get used to this pretty fast and it will become pretty normal. Just respect the system they have and put it in the trash. Every single toilet will have a trash next to it.

>  never flush toilet paper in the toilet

Drying hands with paper is kind of wasteful and almost all of the places I went to did not offer paper towels or hand dryers. You also get used to that quickly. Just air dry them and move on.
