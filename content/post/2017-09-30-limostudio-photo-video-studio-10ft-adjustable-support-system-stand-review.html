<h4>LimoStudio Photo Video Studio 10Ft Adjustable Support System Stand</h4>
<p>LimoStudio can be found all over thew web showcasing their photo and video products. I chose to purchase their green screen based on the Amazon reviews.  A healthy 4 stars with over 3,000 reviews!</p>
<p>Check out the video review and recommendation below.</p>

<h4>Video Review</h4>

<h4>Setup</h4>
<p>Whenever you purchase something that requires a setup, you always dred what is to come! This was different. As soon as I opened up the package I was in relief. I immediately tossed the instructions aside and did what every man does, assemble on my own.</p>
<p>A few things to take notice with assembly:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Actual stands came fully assembled</p></li>
<li><p>No tools, whatsoever, are required</p></li>
<li><p>Assembly is completely intuitive</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The only part I had to do some “thinking” on was when I assembled the rod that goes across the top. Two of the four rods have slightly larger holes on one end. Those are the outer rods that connect to the stands. I happened to have one of them as an inner rod. Quick fix and it was fully assembled.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Total time to assemble, without the video review, i’m guessing 5 to 7 minutes max</p></li>
<li><p>Reassembly time if you had to do it again, 3 minutes max.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="recommendation" class="section level4">
<h4>Recommendation</h4>
<p>If you are interested in a green screen, a curtain, or an event that requires this type of stand, you can’t beat the price and quality. I was amazed at the quality of this product immediately. Truly built for success. Click the link below if you are interested and get your own.</p>
