#### LimoStudio Chromakey Green Screen


Just as I stated with the previous review of the [LimoStudio Stand](http://devgin.com/limostudio-photo…tem-stand-review/), whenever I make a purchase on Amazon, I look at their rating (how many stars) and the quantity of people who actually did rate them. If the business has a 5 star rating with only six reviews, I keep searching. However, if they have a 4.5 star rating with over 100 reviews, that speaks volumes to me.

Check out the video review and recommendation below.

#### Setup


Absolutely no setup required. I didn't even iron or wash this thing before use. It worked perfect.

A few things to take notice with assembly:



 	
  * At 9ft by 15ft, unfolding this took my entire living room space

 	
  * No tools, whatsoever, are required

 	
  * I didn't have to iron it. It has wrinkles; however, I never ironed or washed it and it worked perfect with my software




#### Recommendation


I absolutely recommend this Green Screen. Do not skimp on the size. You can always fold it or tuck parts of it away. You will always wish you had a bigger screen if you end up purchasing a smaller one.

#### First test video


I created this video immediately after I set it up. The quality of the skateboarding is very low and from the late 90's; however, the green screen worked flawless still.
