## Visual Resume Timeline
I came across this [Github](https://github.com/ndphillips/VisualResume) package by ndphillips and thought it was pretty cool and decided to make it even easier to setup. I really just wanted to play with it so here is my excuse. 

![My Visual Resume](VisualResume.png)


## Setup
Most people who have used R for a few weeks or months have probably already installed **devtools**. Just in case it isn't already installed, simply uncomment line 18 to install for the first time 

```{r setup, include=FALSE }
## Uncomment line 10 if you need to install "devtools"
#install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("ndphillips/VisualResume")

library(VisualResume)
```

## Top Left
Fill in **Name**, **Designator**, **Title** and **Company/Office**
Then direclty below that, choose the size of each font

```{r}
## Top Left of Visual Resume
  titles_top_left = c("Mark Gingrass, MBA", ## Name, Designator
                  "Operations Researcher", ## Title
                  "FDA Office of Science / Regulatory Informatics") ## Company/Office
  ## Font sizes
  titles_top_left_font_sizes = c(4, ## Size of Name 
                      2, ## Size of Title
                      1) ## Size of Company/Office
```

## Top Right
Fill in **Personal Web Site**, **Email** and **Github** url. 
Then directly below that, choose the size of each font.

```{r}
  ## Top Right of Visual Resume
    titles_top_right = c("MarkGingrass.com", ## Personal Site
                     "mark.gingrass@gmail.com", ## Email
                     "github.com/mtgingrass") ## Github

    ## Font sizes
    titles_top_right_font_sizes = c(2, ## Size of Personal Site
                         2, ## Size of Email
                         1) ## Size of Github
```

## Timeline Labels
The top and bottom of timeline labels.

```{r}
timeline_top_label <- "Education"
timeline_bottom_lable <- "Career"

timeline_labels = c(timeline_top_label, timeline_bottom_lable)
```

## Timeline Data
Although you can create a timeline from any data range, there is only a finite amount of screen real estate to display it. Technically, you can create a **png** file that can fit larger ranges and display only parts of it at a time on the screen. The choice is yours. 

You can delete or add more entries - just follow the pattern. To add, simply cut and paste the last entry and add a new index value. 

```{r}
## Top and Bottom side of timeline placement
top_side = 1
bottom_side = 0

title_sub_start_end_side = list()
