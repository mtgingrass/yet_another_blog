<h4>LimoStudio Chromakey Green Screen</h4>
<p>Just as I stated with the previous review of the <a href="http://devgin.com/limostudio-photo…tem-stand-review/">LimoStudio Stand</a>, whenever I make a purchase on Amazon, I look at their rating (how many stars) and the quantity of people who actually did rate them. If the business has a 5 star rating with only six reviews, I keep searching. However, if they have a 4.5 star rating with over 100 reviews, that speaks volumes to me.</p>
<p>Check out the video review and recommendation below.</p>

<div id="setup" class="section level4">
<h4>Setup</h4>
<p>Absolutely no setup required. I didn’t even iron or wash this thing before use. It worked perfect.</p>
<p>A few things to take notice with assembly:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At 9ft by 15ft, unfolding this took my entire living room space</p></li>
<li><p>No tools, whatsoever, are required</p></li>
<li><p>I didn’t have to iron it. It has wrinkles; however, I never ironed or washed it and it worked perfect with my software</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="recommendation" class="section level4">
<h4>Recommendation</h4>
<p>I absolutely recommend this Green Screen. Do not skimp on the size. You can always fold it or tuck parts of it away. You will always wish you had a bigger screen if you end up purchasing a smaller one.</p>

<div id="first-test-video" class="section level4">
<h4>First test video</h4>
<p>I created this video immediately after I set it up. The quality of the skateboarding is very low and from the late 90’s; however, the green screen worked flawless still.</p>
