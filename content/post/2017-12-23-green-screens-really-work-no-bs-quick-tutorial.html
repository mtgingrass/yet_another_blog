<h3>Green Screens 101 - Fastest Tutorial</h3>
<p>Review of an affordable green screen that is transportable and sets up quickly. This short 4 minute <a href="https://youtu.be/LNBY3nLvrR0">video</a> is the best way to show how to set up a green screen studio. I will provide the actual links to the products at the end of the review so the page is not cluttered with ads. Watch the video to be convinced how easy this is!!!</p>

<p>Purchase a green screen and stand. $30. LimoStudio 9 x 15 ft. Green Chromakey Muslin Backdrop Background Screen for Photo Video Studio, 3 x Backdrop Clamp. Separate <a href="http://devgin.com/limostudio-photo-video-studio-10ft-adjustable-support-system-stand-review/">review of green screen here</a>. Another <a href="http://devgin.com/limostudio-9-x-15-ft-green-chromakey-green-screen/">review here</a> as well.</p>
<p>Download Free <a href="https://obsproject.com/download">Online Broadcaster Software (OBS) here. Free and open source software for video recording and live streaming.</a> This software is so easy to use and it allows for many controls over layers and filters. Best of all, it’s absolutely free. No trial period, no ads, just plain old free. I can’t thank the OBS team enough for this software.</p>
<p>The only limitation of the software is that there is no way to edit the videos from this software itself. I tend to just go with one long continuous shot and hope for the best. (I hate editing videos by the way.)</p>
<p>Place powerful light facing green screen. I purchased this Nestling 50W Super Bright Outdoor LED Flood Lights, 150W HPS Bulb Equivalent, Waterproof, 6000lm, Daylight White, 6000K, Floodlight,LED Work light, because I also use it for skateboarding. I wanted the most powerful battery power LED I could get.</p>
<p>I recommend purchasing a light specifically for green screen lighting if you don’t have a dual purpose for it. That being said, I have no complaints with this one for my use. Set up as depicted below and as shown in the video.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Place lamp or less powerful light behind the camera</p></li>
<li><p>Stand between the lights and adjust the OBS Chromakey settings (see video)</p></li>
<li><p>Record Video</p></li>
<li><p><em>Optional</em> = for phone tripod, I purchased this and put it too good use.</p></li>
</ol>
