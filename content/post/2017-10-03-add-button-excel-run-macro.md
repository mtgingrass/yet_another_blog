## Adding Button for GUI Interface.


Now that you have a few macros under your belt (some from scratch, some recorded, and some cut/pasted from the internet), it's time to make a user interface for them.

In this tutorial, I will show you how to insert a simple button control to activate your macro. This is a very easy process and it will save you from having to explain to users how to get into the VBA editor.

In this tutorial you will learn:



 	
  * How to insert a button to run macro

 	
  * How to hide VBA code from the general user

 	
  * How to resize and edit the button


Watch this short video for a step by step guide.
