I purposely bought the SwissGear Travel ScanSmart backpack 1900 because it can hold two laptops at the same time. I quickly realized that I made the right decision. You can find this on Amazon for about $49-$69 for prime members [here.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006HFJA12/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=hatro-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B006HFJA12&linkId=960f38fd5d77eb56d578210fee41b31f)

I beat the heck out of this backpack and over stuffed it lots of times. I'm talking packing this thing full of things until you can barley get the zippers closed! I've dragged this bag full of gear onto airplanes, trains, Ubers and more. I am not gentle with it either.Â <!-- more --> I basically lived out of this thing for months. I used it for school books, laptops, and living out of when traveling. I finally made a tear when I stuffed it to the brim with actual sharp objects. I don't blame the manufacture or seller at all for this. No human should have ever stuffed the things I stuffed in there. I still use it as my primary backpack and the hole has not grown at all.
