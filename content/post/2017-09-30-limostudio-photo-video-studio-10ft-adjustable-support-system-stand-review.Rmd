#### LimoStudio Photo Video Studio 10Ft Adjustable Support System Stand




LimoStudio can be found all over thew web showcasing their photo and video products. I chose to purchase their green screen based on the Amazon reviews. Â A healthy 4 stars with over 3,000 reviews!


Check out the video review and recommendation below.

#### Setup


Whenever you purchase something that requires a setup, you always dred what is to come! This was different. As soon as I opened up the package I was in relief. I immediately tossed the instructions aside and did what every man does, assemble on my own.

A few things to take notice with assembly:



 	
  * Actual stands came fully assembled

 	
  * No tools, whatsoever, are required

 	
  * Assembly is completely intuitive


The only part I had to do some "thinking" on was when I assembled the rod that goes across the top. Two of the four rods have slightly larger holes on one end. Those are the outer rods that connect to the stands. I happened to have one of them as an inner rod. Quick fix and it was fully assembled.

 	
  * Total time to assemble, without the video review, i'm guessing 5 to 7 minutes max

 	
  * Reassembly time if you had to do it again, 3 minutes max.




#### Recommendation


If you are interested in a green screen, a curtain, or an event that requires this type of stand, you can't beat the price and quality. I was amazed at the quality of this product immediately. Truly built for success. Click the link below if you are interested and get your own.
