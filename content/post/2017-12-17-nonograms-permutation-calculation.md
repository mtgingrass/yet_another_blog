### Nonogram Permutation


This started with a friend asking for help figuring out a **for** loop. She wanted to know how many different ways she can arrange this setup. Nonograms are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. I was playing around with figuring out how many permutations based on number of columns, hints, and hint values.

I started by looking for patterns by manually plotting a 15 column, 3 hint scenario. The hint values were 5, 2 and 2.
