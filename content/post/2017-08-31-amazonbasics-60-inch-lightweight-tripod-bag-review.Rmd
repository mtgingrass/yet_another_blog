# AmazonBasics 60-Inch Lightweight Tripod with Bag. Amazon's tripod video review.


This tripod will not test the stand of time. The rivets will eventually fall out. It's still useable but very flimsy. Overall, $21 for a good year and half of use if you are some what careful. If you want something to last years, this is not your tripod.
