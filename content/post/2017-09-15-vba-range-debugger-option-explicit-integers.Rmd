## Learn practical code now!


Begin using this code immediately in the workforce! This tutorial will guide you through the use of _ranges_ and how to extract _values_ from cells and input _values_ into cells.

In this tutorial you will learn the basics of:



 	
  * Option Explicit - Why use it?

 	
  * Range - Useful for template building and more.

 	
  * Objects - What are they and tell me more!

 	
  * Debugger - Intro on how to troubleshoot with the debugger.

 	
  * Integer Variables - Storing data outside of Excel.

## Code


Copy and paste this code to get you started.

    
    <code>
    Option Explicit
    'Range Object
    'Debugger
    'What is an object
    'Quick Intro to Integer Variable
    
    Sub my_range()
        Range("A5").Value = 158
        Range("A6").Value = "Hello World"
        Range("A1").Select
        
        Dim my_cool_int As Integer
        
        my_cool_int = Range("A5").Value
        
        Range("D10").Value = my_cool_int
        
        Range("A1:D4").Value = 0
        
    End Sub</code>




## Range,


Use Range to return a _Range_ **object** that represents a single Excel cell or a range of cells. Once a Range object is created, you can extract data from cells or input data into cells with ease.

There are many other types of options for Range objects as well; such as, making it bold, italics, changing font style or size, or even locking the cell for example.</P

## Objects


Visual Basic is an Object-Oriented (OO) language. What is an **object**? An object is just as it sounds, only in a coded language. A television is an object, a basketball is an object, and a car is an object.

Objects have _methods_ and _properties_ (sometimes referred to as _attributes_).

A _method_ is a "do something" action. Turn the television on, change the station, set a timer, or change input methods are examples of _methods_ of an **object**.

Objects have _attributes_Â as well. An _attribute_ is asking the object, "what color are you," or, "how tall are you, " or things such as, "how many miles can you run," or "what are you holding on to?"


## Using Objects


Properties of objects are referenced through the "dot" operator. Simply type the name of the object and an actual "dot" after it.

Example, a Television object might have a property such as **my_TV.**_Return_Channel_; where my_TV is a television **object** and _Return_Channel_ is a _property_ of that object. The properties name is "Return_Channel."

**my_TV.**_Set_Volume_ might be a television **object** called **my_TV** and a _method_ _Set_Volume_ that actually sets the televisions volume.
