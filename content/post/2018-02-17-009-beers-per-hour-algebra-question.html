<h3>The Beer Problem</h3>
<p>I stayed home and pre-gamed it with 4 beers before Ubering to the bar. I can normally throw down 3 Beers each hour at the bar. I was at the bar for 4 hours. How many Beers did I consume?</p>
</div>
<div id="the-b-value" class="section level3">
<h3>The <em>‘b’</em> Value</h3>
<p>The standard equation for a line is, <span class="math inline">\(y = mx + b\)</span>. As we have learned, the <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> part of the equation is where the line crosses the vertical access, often referred to as the <em>initial condition</em>.</p>
<div id="initial-condition" class="section level4">
<h4>Initial Condition</h4>
<p>The <em>b</em> value is considered the <em>initial</em> condition for this problem (pre-game Beers). (Starting at the origin x = 0, or in this case, t = 0).</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the figure below and break it down.</p>

<h3>The Beer Problem</h3>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>We know the initial condition, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(4 Beers\)</span>, giving in the problem. The rate at which beer is consumed is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3 Beers}{Hour}\)</span>, which was also giving. Finally, the question asks, how many total beers after <span class="math inline">\(4 hours\)</span> were consumed.</p>
<p>As you can see from the figure, every time an hour passes, 3 beers are consumed (count them). This corresponds with the rate or <em>m</em> value. Therefore, <span class="math display">\[Rate = m = \frac{3 Beers}{Hour}\]</span></p>
<div id="solution" class="section level4">
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Filling in the full equation we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\#Beers = \frac{3 Beers}{Hour} * 4 Hours + 4 Beers = 16 Beers\]</span></p>
<p>This short video describes the whole process.</p>
