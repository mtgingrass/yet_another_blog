      <description>What is a GitHub? Recently, I went to search for a few jobs in the tech industry and one thing stood out with each of the sites I visited. Everyone was asking “What’s your GitHub address?” Admittedly, I didn’t have one until just the other day.
 I posted this short five minute tutorial to get you started early!  GitHub is a repository for version control hosting of coding projects and much more.</description>

      <description>Adding Button for GUI Interface. Now that you have a few macros under your belt (some from scratch, some recorded, and some cut/pasted from the internet), it’s time to make a user interface for them.
In this tutorial, I will show you how to insert a simple button control to activate your macro. This is a very easy process and it will save you from having to explain to users how to get into the VBA editor.</description>

      <description>Convert File Extensions. Sometimes, you find yourself converting one file extension to another for various reasons. Many software programs will not read files such as a .xlsx or .xlsm Excel file. They will, however, easily read a .csv file.
In this tutorial, I will show you how to use an already created macro to convert an entire directory of files to a new file extensions almost instantly. Saves a tremendous amount of time using macros for this.</description>

      <description>Cells and for loops. In this tutorial, we will take a lateral approach to ranges and instead, use cells.
This quick 5 minute video will walk you through why cells are easier to work with when iterating through loops; specifically, for loops. In addition, this video shows you the value of the debugger when testing programs at runtime. In this tutorial you will learn the basics of:

      <guid>/post/2017/09/21/turn-flat-file-tabular-indexed-sections-data-manipulation-beta/</guid>
      <description>Watch the video on how I take a raw data file with almost 4,000 rows and convert them into tabular sections of data based on a certain column/header value.
I created this today to complete a work tasking but plan on modifying it in the coming days/weeks to be much more user friendly. Despite, this is very useful code for anyone.
