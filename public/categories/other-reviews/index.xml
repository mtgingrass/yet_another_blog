      <description>[embed]https://youtu.be/BdBOOenLd9A?list=PL0oBhq0tLsOBxiq5q__xcWV5WOqS9HGe3[/embed]
Quick review of Picassoâ€™s, Sauced, Empire Slice, Hideaway, The Other Room, and Upper Crust all in the Oklahoma City, OK and metro areas. Plaza District, Paseo District, and Classen Curve.
I like the pizza places that are not chain restaurants and have a great atmosphere where beer is served and they do not sell cheap beer.</description>
