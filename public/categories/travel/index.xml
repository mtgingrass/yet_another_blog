      <description>Pre-plan Where/Why I chose to go to Costa Rica for a few reasons:
 It&amp;rsquo;s winter in February in Washington DC and I wanted to go some place warm. I found a good deal on plane tickets. I heard great things about the country. I want to learn Spanish. It offers both scenary/events as well as partying.  Ticket Details I purchased round trip tickets to Costa Rica from an app called Skyscanner.</description>
