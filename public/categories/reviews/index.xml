      <description>LimoStudio Chromakey Green Screen Just as I stated with the previous review of the LimoStudio Stand, whenever I make a purchase on Amazon, I look at their rating (how many stars) and the quantity of people who actually did rate them. If the business has a 5 star rating with only six reviews, I keep searching. However, if they have a 4.5 star rating with over 100 reviews, that speaks volumes to me.</description>

      <description> [embed]https://youtu.be/oxOTuqTxO6I[/embed]
AmazonBasics 60-Inch Lightweight Tripod with Bag. Amazon’s tripod video review. This tripod will not test the stand of time. The rivets will eventually fall out. It’s still useable but very flimsy. Overall, $21 for a good year and half of use if you are some what careful. If you want something to last years, this is not your tripod.

I purposely bought the SwissGear Travel ScanSmart backpack 1900 because it can hold two laptops at the same time. I quickly realized that I made the right decision. You can find this on Amazon for about $49-$69 for prime members here.
I beat the heck out of this backpack and over stuffed it lots of times.</description>

Quick review of Picasso’s, Sauced, Empire Slice, Hideaway, The Other Room, and Upper Crust all in the Oklahoma City, OK and metro areas. Plaza District, Paseo District, and Classen Curve.
I like the pizza places that are not chain restaurants and have a great atmosphere where beer is served and they do not sell cheap beer.</description>
