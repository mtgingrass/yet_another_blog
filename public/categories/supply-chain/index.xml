Aircraft Availability explained by Mark Gingrass. The airfare uses metrics such as Aircraft Availability to measure how ready the Air Force is to fly.
I am new to most of these terms so please correct me in the comments if I am wrong. I plan to revisit this once I gain a better understanding. This video should lead you in the right direction though.</description>

      <description>Depot Supply Chain Management - DSCM In this short video, I summarize some of the roles of the DSCM (pronounced “disk-um”) within the Depot Supply Chain Management organizations.
In short, the DSCM team understands the future requirements for the Air Force (AF) and makes sure the trickle down supply effects are supportable as well.

      <description>Supply chain management activities should be designed to maximize customer value and achieve a competitive advantage. Supply chains should be efficient and timely. A full supply chain encompasses product development, sourcing (contracts), production (repairs), and logistics (transportation), as well as the software suites to handle the information exchanges.
The product (our assets) has to ultimately get to the end user, or customer. When the customer doesn’t receive the parts that were planned, it could have overwhelming negative effects.</description>

      <description>An Equipment Specialist (ES) is a person who knows the equipment inside and out. Not only must the ES expertly understand the equipment directly, he must know the support equipment, software, demand forecasting, and technical aspects surrounding the equipment.
Watch this short video clip to understand even more about what an ES does on a daily basis.

      <title>Equipment Specialist Excess Inventory Demand Forecasting</title>

      <guid>/post/2017/08/22/equipment-specialist-excess-inventory-demand-forecasting/</guid>
      <description>Excess inventory has pros and cons depending on a variety of factors. Sometimes, a reserve stock of parts on hand is needed because the cost of not having a part immediately is too high.
Inventory has costs. It costs money to store, secure, and account for the parts. It has hidden costs as well. For example, the excess parts cost money to manufacture, repair, or buy. That money could have been used for making different parts that may be needed more.</description>
