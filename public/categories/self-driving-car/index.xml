Self Driving Car Future The self driving car program takes about 3 months per term to complete with a total of 3 terms. The program is broken down into Computer Vision, Sensor Controls, and Planning. Average Salary of a SDC engineer is &amp;gt; $100K.
 Self Driving Car Nano-degree Program I am documenting my Udacity Self Driving Car Nano-degree program progress. This video tells a little about my background and why I signed up for the program.</description>
