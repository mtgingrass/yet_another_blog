      <description>Tweet, Scrape, Manip, Publish It is highly recommended to watch this short video before working with these files. The video explains how each file works and how to run this for your own site.
I will also publish these on my GitHub site here. What is a GitHub you say? See previous post here for quick 5 minute tutorial

      <description>What is a GitHub? Recently, I went to search for a few jobs in the tech industry and one thing stood out with each of the sites I visited. Everyone was asking “What’s your GitHub address?” Admittedly, I didn’t have one until just the other day.
 I posted this short five minute tutorial to get you started early!  GitHub is a repository for version control hosting of coding projects and much more.</description>

      <guid>/post/2017/12/09/data-cleanup-solar-radiation-data-set/</guid>
      <description>Purpose Before you can run a statistical analysis, you may have to clean data. This post is all about using some techniques to clean data. This is not necessarily the best way, or even the correct way to do this; however, it is mean to generate your own ideas for cleaning data in the future.
 Data Location The data comes from the Kaggle site here. It contains over 32,000 observations of Solar Radiation data.</description>

      <description>In my last video tutorial, I demonstrated the steps to tap into the power of the Twitter API to download Tweets based on search terms and import them into R. My plan was to make a follow up video showing how to clean the twitter data and run a Word Cloud on common terms.
However, I ran into a slight snag early on.
The code was supposed to be simple and quick.</description>
