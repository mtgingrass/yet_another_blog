<h1 id="new-job-new-role">New Job - New Role</h1>

<p>At almost all social events, whether on a hike with a group from Meetup or a bar down the street with fellow craft beer drinkers, their is always one question that always comes up. That is, &ldquo;So what do you do?&rdquo; I often ask myself that very same question? In this post, I will try to explain my dialy role as an <strong>Operations Research Analyst.</strong></p>

<p>First off, I am not doing optimization problems or trying to make the production line more efficient. I&rsquo;m also not actually doing <em>research</em>, per se. I will describe some of my major roles and perhaps, you can give me a suitable title.</p>

<h2 id="workflow-requirments">Workflow Requirments</h2>

<p>I help facilitate the requirments required to migrate from a legacy system to a newer system. The system handles a small piece of a larger scale project. Specifically, it allows Program Managers to assign, track, and edit workflows for the scientist that work for them.</p>

<p>When a new or modified product enters the market, the PM will determine which scientists are required to review the product. This could be as many as 16 different disciplined scientist. The syste helps track where in the process the task is at.</p>

<p>This is more of an esthetics role or a Human Integration Role. I determine if the interface is usable for the PMs to do their jobs more efficeintly. This can include things like adding drop down menus, required fields, etc. Standardizing of input data is a huge part of this role.</p>

<p>This project uses the SPRINT method, which is a set period of time during which specific work has to be completed and reviewed. The cadence is usually one task per week. I also help set the exit criteria for the task.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

<p>Submitted ingredient names may include a combination of scientific names, brand names, common
names, abbreviations, descriptions, manufacturer codes, substance registry codes, etc.. The names may contain incorrect punctuation, spelling, hyphenation, or word ordering, and may be not descriptive enough, or overly descriptive. Furthermore, a single manufacturer may use different names for the same substance over time or across products, and manufacturers may differ from each other in the way they name a substance.</p>

<p>These qualities have serious consequences in regulation. They deter a reviewer or researcher from
unambiguously identifying an ingredient. For example, a search for a substance cannot be complete
unless it contains all variations in the name for a substance, information that cannot be known in
advance. Excess variability decreases confidence in conclusions based on the frequency of usage across
time, manufacturers, or products.</p>

<p>I use &lsquo;R&rsquo; to help curate the verbatim reported chemical names (based on a list of business rules) and compose a recommended standardized ingredient name.</p>

<h2 id="data-product-services">Data Product Services</h2>

<h2 id="domain-specific-ontology">Domain Specific Ontology</h2>

<h2 id="exploratory-data-analysis">Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>

<h2 id="data-standardization">Data Standardization</h2>

<h2 id="e-submissions">E-submissions</h2>

<p>I help implement technology to transofrm how our Center recieves, processes, and manages documents for later use in analysis. To do this, I must understand the entire workflow process of how <em>submissions</em> work. Some of the work includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Catagorization</li>
<li>Writing Guidance for Industry</li>
<li>Handle amendments</li>
<li>Develop Reports</li>
</ul>

<p>By <em>implement technology</em> I mean, informing contractors what our needs are and write specific requirments for them to actually deliver the proper hardware/software solutions.</p>

<h2 id="ingest-modeling">Ingest Modeling</h2>

<p>An over arching process that incompasses my division as well as two more layers above is what we refer to as &ldquo;Ingest Modeling&rdquo;. Our team is trying to map the entire process our Center uses to do the work, from cradle to grave. We are mapping this process for a couple of reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>It hasn&rsquo;t been mapped before</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t know where you are, you can&rsquo;t get to where you want to go</li>
<li>We can now get metrics for the processes</li>
</ol>
