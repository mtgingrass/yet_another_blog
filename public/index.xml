      <description>Pre-plan Where to go and why? I chose to go to Costa Rica for a few reasons:
 It&amp;rsquo;s winter in February in Washington DC and I wanted to go some place warm. I found a good deal on plane tickets. I heard great things about the country. I want to learn Spanish. It offers both scenery/events as well as partying.  Ticket Details I purchased round trip tickets to Costa Rica from an app called Skyscanner.</description>

      <description>Breaking into the tech world takes time! Forget about coding in C++ or Python or learning Ruby on Rails. Just figuring out which tools or Integrated Environments (IDE), or even which Operating System (OS) to use can be overwhelming.
In this post, I am going to break down some of the tools I am currently using and why. I&amp;rsquo;m also going to try and break down my thought process of how I even found out which tools to use.</description>

      <description>The question is, what are my transferable skills? What do I bring to the table? This is what this blog post is going to be all about, how to bring a unique set of skills to a field you have never been part of, and to use that for your advantage. Can I even do this?
I will start with how I brought unique tools to a field I never thought I would be in.</description>

Self Driving Car Future The self driving car program takes about 3 months per term to complete with a total of 3 terms. The program is broken down into Computer Vision, Sensor Controls, and Planning. Average Salary of a SDC engineer is &amp;gt; $100K.
 Self Driving Car Nano-degree Program I am documenting my Udacity Self Driving Car Nano-degree program progress. This video tells a little about my background and why I signed up for the program.</description>

Aircraft Availability explained by Mark Gingrass. The airfare uses metrics such as Aircraft Availability to measure how ready the Air Force is to fly.
I am new to most of these terms so please correct me in the comments if I am wrong. I plan to revisit this once I gain a better understanding. This video should lead you in the right direction though.</description>

The Beer Problem I can chug a beer pretty fast. I recently timed myself drinking a full 12oz Beer (355mL) in just about 6 seconds. At what rate is the beer flowing down my throat?
 Slope The slope formula, \(m = \frac{rise}{run}\), is a powerful tool for calculating and comparing steepness, or rates of changes. This is a very useful tool used in all aspects of engineering, mathematics, and even deep learning with neural networks.</description>

The Beer Problem I stayed home and pre-gamed it with 4 beers before Ubering to the bar. I can normally throw down 3 Beers each hour at the bar. I was at the bar for 4 hours. How many Beers did I consume?
 The ‘b’ Value The standard equation for a line is, \(y = mx + b\). As we have learned, the \(b\) part of the equation is where the line crosses the vertical access, often referred to as the initial condition.</description>

      <description>Nonogram Permutation This started with a friend asking for help figuring out a for loop. She wanted to know how many different ways she can arrange this setup. Nonograms are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. I was playing around with figuring out how many permutations based on number of columns, hints, and hint values.</description>

This is not necessarily the best way, or even the correct way to do this; however, it is mean to generate your own ideas for cleaning data in the future.
 Data Location The data comes from the Kaggle site here. It contains over 32,000 observations of Solar Radiation data.</description>

      <description>Supply chain management activities should be designed to maximize customer value and achieve a competitive advantage. Supply chains should be efficient and timely. A full supply chain encompasses product development, sourcing (contracts), production (repairs), and logistics (transportation), as well as the software suites to handle the information exchanges.
The product (our assets) has to ultimately get to the end user, or customer. When the customer doesn’t receive the parts that were planned, it could have overwhelming negative effects.</description>

      <description>Adding Button for GUI Interface. Now that you have a few macros under your belt (some from scratch, some recorded, and some cut/pasted from the internet), it’s time to make a user interface for them.
In this tutorial, I will show you how to insert a simple button control to activate your macro. This is a very easy process and it will save you from having to explain to users how to get into the VBA editor.</description>

      <description>Convert File Extensions. Sometimes, you find yourself converting one file extension to another for various reasons. Many software programs will not read files such as a .xlsx or .xlsm Excel file. They will, however, easily read a .csv file.
In this tutorial, I will show you how to use an already created macro to convert an entire directory of files to a new file extensions almost instantly. Saves a tremendous amount of time using macros for this.</description>

      <description>LimoStudio Chromakey Green Screen Just as I stated with the previous review of the LimoStudio Stand, whenever I make a purchase on Amazon, I look at their rating (how many stars) and the quantity of people who actually did rate them. If the business has a 5 star rating with only six reviews, I keep searching. However, if they have a 4.5 star rating with over 100 reviews, that speaks volumes to me.</description>

      <description>Cells and for loops. In this tutorial, we will take a lateral approach to ranges and instead, use cells.
This quick 5 minute video will walk you through why cells are easier to work with when iterating through loops; specifically, for loops. In addition, this video shows you the value of the debugger when testing programs at runtime. In this tutorial you will learn the basics of:

I created this today to complete a work tasking but plan on modifying it in the coming days/weeks to be much more user friendly. Despite, this is very useful code for anyone.

      <description>What is a kilo-ton (kt) anyway? For all practical purposes, the “yield” of a nuclear bomb is a measure of how many tons or megatons of TNT it would take to match the detonation power of the nuclear explosion.
Using a truck-based fertilizer bomb, Oklahoma’s Cities Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was destroyed with about 0.002 kt of explosive power. Nagasaki’s “Fat Man”gravity bomb was just over 20 kt, or about 10,000 times more powerful than the Murrah bombing.</description>

AmazonBasics 60-Inch Lightweight Tripod with Bag. Amazon’s tripod video review. This tripod will not test the stand of time. The rivets will eventually fall out. It’s still useable but very flimsy. Overall, $21 for a good year and half of use if you are some what careful. If you want something to last years, this is not your tripod.

      <guid>/post/2017/08/22/equipment-specialist-excess-inventory-demand-forecasting/</guid>
      <description>Excess inventory has pros and cons depending on a variety of factors. Sometimes, a reserve stock of parts on hand is needed because the cost of not having a part immediately is too high.
Inventory has costs. It costs money to store, secure, and account for the parts. It has hidden costs as well. For example, the excess parts cost money to manufacture, repair, or buy. That money could have been used for making different parts that may be needed more.</description>

Your very first C++ program using a free version of Visual Studio 2015.. I increase font size in the later videos to help with readability.
Don’t have Visual Studio or want to choose other alternatives? No problem. This post will show you how to get started using an Online compiler, DevC++ (free) and how to download Visual Studio Community 2015.
I highly recommend any of the Deitel &amp;amp; Deitel books like this one linked: http://amzn.</description>
