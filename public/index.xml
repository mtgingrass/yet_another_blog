      <description>Pre-plan Where/Why I chose to go to Costa Rica for a few reasons:
 It&amp;rsquo;s winter in February in Washington DC and I wanted to go some place warm. I found a good deal on plane tickets. I heard great things about the country. I want to learn Spanish. It offers both scenary/events as well as partying.  Ticket Details I purchased round trip tickets to Costa Rica from an app called Skyscanner.</description>

      <description>Visual Resume Timeline I came across this Github package by ndphillips and thought it was pretty cool and decided to make it even easier to setup. I really just wanted to play with it so here is my excuse.
My Visual Resume
  Setup Most people who have used R for a few weeks or months have probably already installed devtools. Just in case it isn’t already installed, simply uncomment line 18 to install for the first time</description>

      <description>Breaking into the tech world takes time! Forget about coding in C++ or Python or learning Ruby on Rails. Just figuring out which tools or Integrated Environments (IDE), or even which Operating System (OS) to use can be overwhelming.
In this post, I am going to break down some of the tools I am currently using and why. I&amp;rsquo;m also going to try and break down my thought process of how I even found out which tools to use.</description>

      <description>The question is, what are my transferable skills? What do I bring to the table? This is what this blog post is going to be all about, how to bring a unique set of skills to a field you have never been part of, and to use that for your advantage. Can I even do this?
I will start with how I brought unique tools to a field I never thought I would be in.</description>
