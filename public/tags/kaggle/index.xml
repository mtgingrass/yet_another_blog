      <description>Purpose Before you can run a statistical analysis, you may have to clean data. This post is all about using some techniques to clean data. This is not necessarily the best way, or even the correct way to do this; however, it is mean to generate your own ideas for cleaning data in the future.
 Data Location The data comes from the Kaggle site here. It contains over 32,000 observations of Solar Radiation data.</description>
