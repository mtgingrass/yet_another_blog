AmazonBasics 60-Inch Lightweight Tripod with Bag. Amazon’s tripod video review. This tripod will not test the stand of time. The rivets will eventually fall out. It’s still useable but very flimsy. Overall, $21 for a good year and half of use if you are some what careful. If you want something to last years, this is not your tripod.

I purposely bought the SwissGear Travel ScanSmart backpack 1900 because it can hold two laptops at the same time. I quickly realized that I made the right decision. You can find this on Amazon for about $49-$69 for prime members here.
I beat the heck out of this backpack and over stuffed it lots of times.</description>
