The Beer Problem I can chug a beer pretty fast. I recently timed myself drinking a full 12oz Beer (355mL) in just about 6 seconds. At what rate is the beer flowing down my throat?
 Slope The slope formula, \(m = \frac{rise}{run}\), is a powerful tool for calculating and comparing steepness, or rates of changes. This is a very useful tool used in all aspects of engineering, mathematics, and even deep learning with neural networks.</description>

      <description>Supply chain management activities should be designed to maximize customer value and achieve a competitive advantage. Supply chains should be efficient and timely. A full supply chain encompasses product development, sourcing (contracts), production (repairs), and logistics (transportation), as well as the software suites to handle the information exchanges.
The product (our assets) has to ultimately get to the end user, or customer. When the customer doesnâ€™t receive the parts that were planned, it could have overwhelming negative effects.</description>
