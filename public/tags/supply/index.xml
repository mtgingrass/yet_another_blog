      <description>Depot Supply Chain Management - DSCM In this short video, I summarize some of the roles of the DSCM (pronounced “disk-um”) within the Depot Supply Chain Management organizations.

      <description>Supply chain management activities should be designed to maximize customer value and achieve a competitive advantage. Supply chains should be efficient and timely.
