      <description>What is a kilo-ton (kt) anyway? For all practical purposes, the “yield” of a nuclear bomb is a measure of how many tons or megatons of TNT it would take to match the detonation power of the nuclear explosion.
Using a truck-based fertilizer bomb, Oklahoma’s Cities Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was destroyed with about 0.002 kt of explosive power. Nagasaki’s “Fat Man”gravity bomb was just over 20 kt, or about 10,000 times more powerful than the Murrah bombing.</description>
