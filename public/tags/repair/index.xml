      <description>Supply chain management activities should be designed to maximize customer value and achieve a competitive advantage. Supply chains should be efficient and timely. A full supply chain encompasses product development, sourcing (contracts), production (repairs), and logistics (transportation), as well as the software suites to handle the information exchanges.
The product (our assets) has to ultimately get to the end user, or customer. When the customer doesnâ€™t receive the parts that were planned, it could have overwhelming negative effects.</description>

      <description>Excess inventory has pros and cons depending on a variety of factors. Sometimes, a reserve stock of parts on hand is needed because the cost of not having a part immediately is too high.
