The Beer Problem I can chug a beer pretty fast. I recently timed myself drinking a full 12oz Beer (355mL) in just about 6 seconds. At what rate is the beer flowing down my throat?
 Slope The slope formula, \(m = \frac{rise}{run}\), is a powerful tool for calculating and comparing steepness, or rates of changes. This is a very useful tool used in all aspects of engineering, mathematics, and even deep learning with neural networks.</description>
